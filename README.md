## Design Process

API developer- Wei Xian
Front End Developer - Wei Xian and Denette

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
Our design process is to create a simple, interactive and fully responsive Technology E-commerce website called TECHO that has api implementations and lotties for a good user experience. Our users will mainly be younger people who are tech-savvy and buy tech products often. Therefore, our website has a bold, pop of colour, rounded designs, with micro interactions to keep up with the latest design trends. They are looking forward to get great deals on tech products and our website achieves that, by mainly focusing on technology related items to lower operational costs, and also implementing 'tokens' that users can leverage on to slash prices. Gamification aspects are also well integrated to retain these tech-savvy users.


TC-1 As a seller, I want the website to provide a convenient process to sell for a good user experience
TC-2 As a seller, I want the website to advertise my products so that I have a better chance at profitting
TC-3 As a user, I want the website to have a variety of products so it can be highly functional
TC-4 As a user, I want the interface to be aethetically pleasing so I can have the optimal experience
TC-5 As a user, I want the colour-scheme to be high contrast and visible so that I have a easy time using the app
TC-6 A a product owner, I want good quality products to be on my website so there is good user experience
TC-7 As a user, I want to be able to have 3D models of products so I can see what they look like and make an informed decision
TC-8 As a product owner, I want my website to have micro-interactions so that I can make the user experience more engaging
TC-9 As a product owner, I want my platform to have a gamification system so that I can keep users on my platform
TC-10 As a user, I want my information to be stored so that I do not have to log in every time I use the platform

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
